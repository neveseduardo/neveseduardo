# 👋 Hi, I'm Eduardo Neves

Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer with solid experience building reliable systems for real business needs.

Over the years, I’ve learned that good software is not just about writing code — it’s about communication, responsibility, and long-term thinking.

## 🧭 How I Work

- I care about code readability and structure  
- I prioritize solutions that are easy to maintain  
- I try to understand business context before coding
